# Suspended Ticket Nuke App

Select causes of suspension in the app settings then the app is used to bulk delete all suspended tickets with the selected causes.

Currently there is no bulk recover functionality however that is planned for the next release.

Please send your bug reports to [Jeremiah Currier](https://github.com/jeremiahcurrier). Pull requests are welcome.
